    },
    {
      q: "Is arthroscopy a major surgery?",
      a: "Nope! Arthroscopy is minimally invasive—it uses tiny incisions, a camera, and precision tools to fix problems inside your joint without cutting open the whole area.",
    },
    {
      q: "How long is the recovery?",
      a: "Recovery varies based on the procedure, but many people return to work or light activities within 1–2 weeks, and sports in 4–12 weeks with proper rehab.",
    },
    {
      q: "Will I need physical therapy?",
